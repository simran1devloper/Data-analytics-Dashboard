# Data-analytics-Dashboard
In this project, I built  an interactive Power BI Sales Dashboard using Super Sales Data. Applied Power Query for data cleaning and transformation, and used DAX for calculated measures and KPIs like Total Sales and Profit Margins. Designed visuals with KPI cards, charts,  and slicers for dynamic, data-driven insights.
